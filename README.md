# communal_canvas
Site where users can draw (are forced to, really) with their cursors on the same canvas.

I worked off of this canvas tutorial: http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-drawing-app/, modified it slightly, and adapted it to Angular. I then added a backend so that the drawings can be saved and added sockets so that users can see what other users are drawing in real-time.
